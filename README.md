## [Colab Example (Google's Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/jtclark2/coursera_cloud_techtalk/blob/main/CloudComputingFoundation_TechnicalDiscussion.ipynb)
Opening Colab will allow you to edit a **copy** of the colab file, so edits will not impact the repo.
In order to update the repo, you would need to:
1) check out the repo
2) open and modify the colab file
3) save the colab file, overwriting the original
4) Add and commit the updates (just like any git commit)

## Making videos
There are tons of tools for this. An easy post-covid tool that many people have is Zoom. 
1) Create meeting (you don't need to invite anybody)
2) Start Recording (the button is right on the bottom)
3) Join with audio/video, or just screenshare
4) Stop recording 
5) Navigate to zoom recording (On Windows default --> `C:\Users\[UserName]\Documents\Zoom\[DateTimeStamp]`)
6) Convert files from .zoom to .mp4 : Just close the meeting
7) Open and play files
